Tower of Hanoi game in Typescript/React.

Small project to get started with Typescript, which btw, it's really awesome! IMHO [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) is the best resource to get started.

[React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) is an interesting library for adding drag/drop capabilities to your components.
